(A plain Vagrant setup script to get Drupal 8 up and running quickly.)

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this project! Unfortunately, I don't have time to maintain it anymore.

It seems like https://github.com/nickschuch/vd8 would be an excellent alternative.

If you plan to maintain your own fork of this project and would like me to link to it here, please let me know!
